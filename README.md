# TextToPDF
Compile by entering command "make"

Run from succesfull build "TextToPDF" in the bin folder

Needs a path as a command line argument ie. "TextToPDF data/mobydick.txt"

Currently only works on txt files, this may change in the future

# Possible Updates
Make main.cpp into a class called PDF to tidy up main

Make each cpp file have a header rather than one header file having multiple cpp files

Add support for images / cataloging
